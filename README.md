## Project Description

There is a lot of text to speech applications on the market now such as an Intelligent Speaker- extension for a browser that reads books, articles, docs and pdf files in an almost human voice. Almost all of such text-to-speech applications have trouble with voicing the formulas, especially mathematical formulas. Therefore, we decided to write an application that could identify the formulas in a text and voice them. Considering that there are various formulas in the scientific world, we decided to focus our application more on voicing LateX formulas which is a high-quality document preparation system, especially for scientific documents.

### Who will use it?

This application will prove beneficial to the scientific community especially blind professors, students, and research scientists. Below is an example of a potential user sharing his plight online.
